# Life in Weeks

This simple Python script calculates the number of weeks left to live based on a maximum age of 90 years.

## How It Works
1. The user inputs their current age.
2. The script calculates how many years remain until the user reaches 90.
3. It then converts the remaining years into weeks and displays the result.
